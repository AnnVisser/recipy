# 5 Minute, 5 Ingredient Tiramisu

Tiramisu in 5 minutes...a great dessert hack and a total crowd pleaser!

**Serves 8**

## INGREDIENTS

500 g vegan cream whipped
50 g cocoa powder
60 g icing sugar
300 ml strong coffee
500 g digestive biscuit
300 g tea leaves
300g other disgusting stuff
etc etc

## INSTRUCTIONS

Brew your coffee good and strong and add in 3 tbsp of icing sugar and mix well.
Whip the cream until it reaches stiff peaks and add in 3 tbsp of icing sugar and mix well.
Dunk each biscuit twice to three times, depending on how hard the biscuits are as you want the biscuits to break down and end up almost like a sponge after soaking and sitting. Get a baking tray approx 25cm x 25cm x 3cm high or else 9 x9 inches x .3inches and layer on a single layer of the soaked biscuits. Add a generous layer of cream followed by a nice dusting or sprinkling of cocao powder.
Do another layer of soaked biscuits, followed by a layer of cream and a generous dusting of cacao powder again et voila your tiramisu is good to go!

dont forget to film if others eat your disgusting recipe stuff.
